# Molecular-Properties-Prediction-by-GNN
This repo is for the final project of advanced Machine Learning class
This project has innovatively applied Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques to predict the permeability of chemical compounds, demonstrating the utility of GNNs in this domain. Our results, employing GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT models, achieved accuracies that are on par with or surpass current state-of-the-art findings. The GCN model outperformed the others, delivering the highest accuracies with the least variation in losses. Although the GraphSAGE and GAT models experienced greater fluctuations in validation loss, they still achieved satisfactory accuracies. This underscores the potential of GNN methods in chemical analysis and suggests that further fine-tuning of hyperparameters could enhance model performance. This study not only confirms the effectiveness of GNNs in predicting chemical compound characteristics but also sets the stage for future advancements in this critical area of research.
